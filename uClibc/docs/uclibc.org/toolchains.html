<h3>Toolchains</h3>
To use uClibc, you need to have a toolchain, which is composed
of <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/">binutils</a>, 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, and of course uClibc.

<ul>

    <li>You can build your own 
	<a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/toolchain/gcc-3.3.x/">uClibc toolchain</a>
	using this to automagically download all the needed source code
	and compile everything for you.
    <p> 

    <li>Steven J. Hill has kindly provided 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.realitydiluted.com/linux/MIPS/toolchains">RPMs and SRPMs</a>
	with toolchains for mips.
    <p> 

    <li>You can compile your own uClibc development system using
	<a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a>.
    <p> 

    <li>Prebuilt uClibc development systems for
	<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_i386.bz2">i386</a>
	and
	<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_arm.bz2">arm</a>
	and 
	<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_mipsel.bz2">mipsel</a>
	are available and contain complete native gcc 3.3.2 toolchains.  These
	are development systems are ext2 filesystems that runs natively on the
	specified architecture.  They contain all the development software you
	need to build your own uClibc applications, including bash, coreutils,
	findutils, diffutils, patch, sed, ed, flex, bison, file, gawk, tar,
	grep gdb, strace, make, gcc, g++,  autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib,
	openssl, openssh perl, and more.   And of course, everything is
	dynamically linked against uClibc.  By using a uClibc only system, you
	can avoid all the painful cross-configuration problems that have made
	using uClibc somewhat painful in the past.  If you want to quickly get
	started with testing or using uClibc you should give these images a
	try.  You can loop mount them and then chroot into them.  You can boot
	into them using user-mode Linux.  You can even 'dd' them to a spare
	partition and use resize2fs to make them fill the drive, and then boot
	into them.  Whatever works for you.
