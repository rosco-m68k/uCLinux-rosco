    <li> <b>3 January 2004, uClibc 0.9.26 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is sorry to announce there was a pthred bug that
    slipped though our extensive testing and was only noticed a few hours after
    the previous release.  As a result, we are now releasing uClibc 0.9.26
    which fixes this bug, and is otherwise identical to the previous release.

    This release remains binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21-25, as long as
    you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that will break things.
    Please be aware we <b>will</b> break binary compatibilty in the upcoming
    0.9.27 release to implement a few necessary changes we have been
    postponing.  That will hopefully be the last ABI change before we freeze
    the ABI for the upcoming 1.0.x stable uClibc series.

    <li> <b>3 January 2004, uClibc 0.9.25 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.25.  This contains many bug fixes and cleanups, and is
    recommended for anyone using uClibc.  This release remains binary
    compatible with uClibc 0.9.21-24 (as long as you take care to avoid any
    configuraton changes that will break things).  We <b>were</b> planning to break
    binary compatibilty in this release, but decided to hold those changes so
    we could push out a bugfix release.

    <p>

    Please be aware we <b>will</b> break binary compatibilty in the upcoming
    0.9.26 release to implement a few changes we have been postponing.  That
    will hopefully be the last ABI change before we freeze the ABI for the
    upcoming 1.0.x stable uClibc series.

    The powerpc dev system mostly works, but there are still some

    <li> <b>15 December 2003, uClibc 0.9.24 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.24.  This contains various minor updates and fixes for a few
    silly configuration problems.  Arm users should notice a speed increase
    since some arm optimized string functions have been added.  And several
    bugs have been fixed.

    <p>

    This release continues to be binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21 to 0.9.23
    -- as long as you pick compatible configuration options.  The next release
    will <b>not</b> be binary compatible.  We've been saving up a few needed
    changes that will be going into the next release, so while you will not
    need to recompile all your applications and libraries just yet, keep in
    mind we will have a flag day soon...
