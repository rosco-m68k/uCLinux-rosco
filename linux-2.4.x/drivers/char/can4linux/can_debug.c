 * Import of uClinux-2.4.22-uc0
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/07/18 00:11:46  gerg
 * I followed as much rules as possible (I hope) and generated a patch for the
 * uClinux distribution. It contains an additional driver, the CAN driver, first
 * for an SJA1000 CAN controller:
 *   uClinux-dist/linux-2.4.x/drivers/char/can4linux
 * In the "user" section two entries
 *   uClinux-dist/user/can4linux     some very simple test examples
 *   uClinux-dist/user/horch         more sophisticated CAN analyzer example
 *
 * Patch submitted by Heinz-Juergen Oertel <oe@port.de>.

    /* ttys were originally hardware devices, which

     * According to ASCII, to move to a new line you
     * need two characters, a carriage return and a
     * line feed. In Unix, on the other hand, the
     * ASCII line feed is used for both purposes - so
     * we can't just use \n, because it wouldn't have
     * a carriage return and the next line will
     * start at the column right
     *                          after the line feed.
     *
     * BTW, this is the reason why the text file
     * format is different between Unix and Windows.
     * In CP/M and its derivatives, such as MS-DOS and
     * Windows, the ASCII standard was strictly
     * adhered to, and therefore a new line requires
     * both a line feed and a carriage return.
