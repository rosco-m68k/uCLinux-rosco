This is the port of uClinux to the Microblaze softcore processor.

Please note, the port is still experimental!  Many things simply do 
not work, and more have never been tested.

The port is based *heavily* on the NEC v850 port by Miles Bader.  
This has potentially introduced some strange coding and design decisions
in the Microblaze code.  In particular, the low level stuff in entry.S
may seem a bit odd.  It was done this way to simplify the porting process.

No effort has been made to streamline the low level kernel code.  As Hoare
said (and restated by Knuth), 

	"Premature optimisation is the root of all Evil"

Words to live by.

As of April 2003, the only hardware target supported is a ficticious 
Microblaze system called MBVANILLA.  The mhs, mss and other design
files necessary to synthesise this platform are found in 
/Vendors/Insight/XC2V1K/hardware.

Contributions to the Microblaze porting effort are welcome!

Have fun.
