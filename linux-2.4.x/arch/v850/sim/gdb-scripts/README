This directory contains some shell and gdb scripts useful for debugging.


   example.gdbinit	An example `.gdbinit' file that sets things up
			to run linux in the gdb v850 simulator.  It
			assumes that all the patch files in ../patches
			have been applied.


The following are gdb scripts that when loaded into gdb (using the `source'
command) will install breakpoints which print out information at interesting
times:

   trace-loadproc.gdb	Print a message for each process exec.
   trace-switch.gdb	Print a message for each context switch.
   trace-irq.gdb	Print messages for interrupts/interrupt returns.
   trace-traps.gdb	Print messages for traps (syscalls) & trap returns.
