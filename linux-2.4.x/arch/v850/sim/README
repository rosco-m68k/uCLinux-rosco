This directory contains some useful files for debugging using the gdb
v850 simulator.


   gdb-scripts/		An example .gdbrc and useful gdb scripts.

   patches/		Patches for the simulator and gdb

   updroot		A shell script that copies a directory tree called
			`root' into an ext2 filesystem image called
			`root.ext2', which is the name the simulator-specific
			startup code in the uclinux v850 port looks for to
			initialize the root filesystem.
