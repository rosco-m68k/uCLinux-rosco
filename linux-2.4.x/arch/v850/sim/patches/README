This directory contains patches to gdb and the gdb v850 simulator.
Some are necessary to run uclinux, others are useful for debugging.


 Bug fixes:

   sim-bitop-bug.patch	  Fixes a bug in the simulator implementation of
			  bit operators.

   sim-trap-addr.patch	  Fixes a bug where the simulator uses the wrong
			  address for vectoring to a software trap.


 New features (necessary):

   sim-interrupt-priority.patch
			  Adds interrupt priorities to the simulator's
			  implementation of `hardware' interrupts.

   sim-halt.patch	  Makes the `halt' instruction work like a real
			  hardware halt instruction.  The implementation
			  is non-optimal -- it simply busy-waits.


 New features (optional):

   gdb-sim-inftty.patch   A patches to make gdb manage tty modes in the
			  simulator the same way it does with a real
			  process inferior.  This allows the simulator
			  to switch to raw mode without interfering with
			  debugging.

   sim-makeraw.patch      Adds a simulator `syscall' named `make_raw', which
			  allows a program running on the simulator to
			  switch the real terminal into raw mode.

   sim-raw-stdio.patch	  Adds the simulator command `stdio on|off',
			  which allows switching on or off special
			  treatment of stdio I/O.

   sim-poll.patch	  Adds `poll' as a simulator `syscall', allowing
			  polling of real file descriptors by the
			  simulated program.


Debugging aids:

These patches must be applied in order, since later patches depend on
features added by earlier ones.

   sim-record-branches.patch	Adds the simulator command `recent-branches'
				which will dump information about the last
				32 branches taken by the simulated program.

   sim-lomem-protect.patch	Adds the simulator commands
				`read-protect-low-memory BOUNDARY',
				`write-protect-low-memory BOUNDARY', and
				`protected-low-memory-info'.

   sim-himem-trace.patch	Adds the simulator command
				`trace-io-writes on|off' (which traces
				writes to `I/O space' (above 0xFFFFF000).
