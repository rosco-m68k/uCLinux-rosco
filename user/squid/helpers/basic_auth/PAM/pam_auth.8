.SH NAME
pam_auth - Squid PAM authentication helper
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
squid_pam_auth [-n "service name"] [-t TTL] [-o] [-1]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This helper allows Squid to connect to a mostly any available PAM
database to validate the user name and password of Basic HTTP
authentication.
.
.TP
.BI "-s " "service-name"
Specifies the PAM service name Squid uses, defaults to "squid"
.
.TP
.BI "-t " TTL
Unless the -1 option is used, this specified for how long
the connection to the PAM database should be kept open and
reused for new logins. Defaults to 60 seconds.
.
.TP
.BI "-o"
Do not perform the PAM account management group (account
expiration etc)

.TP
.BI "-1"
Specifies "One shot" mode, where a new PAM connection will
be opened for each new user. This is how PAM is normally
used and may be required by some backend databases.
The default is to reuse the PAM connection to maximize
performance. (see -t above)
.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.
The program needs a PAM service to be configured in 
.B /etc/pam.conf
or
.B /etc/pam.d/<servicename>
.P
The default service name is "squid", and the program makes use
of the
.BR "" ' auth "' and '" account '
management groups to verify the password and the accounts validity.
.P
For details on how to configure PAM services, see the PAM
documentation for your system. This manual does not cover PAM
configuration details.
.
.SH NOTES
.
When used for authenticating to local UNIX shadow password databases
the program must be running as root or else it won't have sufficient
permissions to access the user password database. Such use of this
program is not recommended, but if you absolutely need to then make
the program setuid root
.RS
.P
.B chown root pam_auth
.br
.B chmod u+s pam_auth
.RE
.P
Please note that in such configurations it is also strongly recommended
that the program is moved into a directory where normal users cannot
access it, as this mode of operation will allow any local user to
brute-force other users passwords. Also note the program has not been
fully audited and the author cannot be held responsible for any security
issues due to such installations.
