.
.SH NAME
squid_ldap_group - Squid LDAP external acl group helper
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
squid_ldap_group -b "base DN" -f "LDAP search filter" [options] [ldap_server_name[:port]...]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This helper allows Squid to connect to a LDAP directory to
authorize users via LDAP groups.
.P
The program operates by searching with a search filter based
on the users login name and requested group, and if a match
is found it is determined that the user belongs to the group.
.
.TP
.BI "-b " "basedn " (REQUIRED)
Specifies the base DN under which the groups are located.
.
.TP
.BI "-B " "basedn "
Specifies the base DN under which the users are located (if different)
.
.TP
.B "-g"
Specifies that the first query argument sent to the helper by Squid is
a extension to the basedn and will be temporarily added infront of the
global basedn for this query.
.
.TP
.BI "-f " filter
LDAP search filter used to search the LDAP directory for any
matching group memberships.
.BR
In the filter %u will be replaced by the user login name (or DN if
the -F or -u options are used) and %g by the requested group name.
.
.TP
.BI "-F " filter
LDAP search filter used to search the LDAP directory for any
matching users.
.BR
In the filter %s will be replaced by the user login name. If % is to be
included literally in the filter then use %%.
.
.TP
.BI "-u " attr
LDAP attribute used to construct the user DN from the login name and
base dn.
.
.TP
.BI "-s " base|one|sub
search scope. Defaults to 'sub'.
.IP
.B base
object only,
.B one
level below the base object or
.BR sub tree
below the base object
.
.TP
.BI "-D " "binddn " "-w " password
The DN and password to bind as while performing searches. Required
if the directory does not allow anonymous searches.
.IP
As the password needs to be printed in plain text in your Squid configuration
and will be sent on the command line to the helper it is strongly recommended
to use a account with minimal associated privileges.  This to limit the damage
in case someone could get hold of a copy of your Squid configuration file or
extracts the password used from a process listing.
.
.TP
.BI -P
Use a persistent LDAP connection. Normally the LDAP connection
is only open while validating a username to preserve resources
at the LDAP server. This option causes the LDAP connection to
be kept open, allowing it to be reused for further user
validations. Recommended for larger installations.
.
.TP
.BI -R
do not follow referrals
.
.TP
.BI "-a " never|always|search|find
when to dereference aliases. Defaults to 'never'
.IP
.BI never
dereference aliases (default),
.BI always
dereference aliases, only while
.BR search ing
or only to
.B find
the base object
.
.TP
.BI -h " ldapserver"
Specify the LDAP server to connect to
.TP
.BI -p " ldapport"
Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening if
other than the default LDAP port 389.
.
.TP
.BI -S
Strip NT domain name component from usernames (/ or \\ separated)
.
.SH SQUID CONFIGURATION

.SH NOTES
.
When constructing search filters it is strongly recommended to test the filter
using ldapsearch before you attempt to use squid_ldap_group. This to verify
that the filter matches what you expect.
