MISC INFO

Thanks to Greg Haerr, it now works somewhat reliably with the MicrowWindows
0.84 release of Nano-X. Most should still also work with 0.5pre3, but I've
not tested that.

Did I mention there's no warranties? Well, there isn't. This code
is highly experimental, and needs a lot of work. Oh, and don't complain
to me about how it looks. I've started to add hooks for attaching
rendering objects to the widgets, to make the whole system themable,
and the current look is like it is only for debugging purposes.

For now, please send patches to me by e-mail. We'll get it into
CVS later.
