	  nwidget programs at once.
	* Added n_main() utility function.

      I've intergrated Greg's changes to 0.1, and split the (unfinished)
      textfield widget into it's it's own file. I've also started to add a
      simple listview widget, and started moving rendering into a separate
      class.
 
      * Improved the rendering of the text field a lot. *HOWEVER* it will
        probably look really bad on 0.5pre3 due to lack of text clipping.

      * Text field now uses MODE_XOR for the cursor.

      * Fixed some of the calculations regarding cursor positioning etc.
        for the textfield.
	
      * Started adding a simple 3D look.
