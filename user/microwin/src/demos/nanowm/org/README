29th May 2000- NanoWM Version 0.1.

This is a first cut at a window manager for NanoGUI.
Many things are as yet unimplemented, unfinished, ugly and/or inefficient.

Currently working:
	Windows get reparented when they appear.
	They are placed in a (unintelligent) stacking order.
	They are decorated with a title bar (no title as yet though), four
	buttons, and resizing borders.
	Windows can be dragged using the title bar (currently only solid
	window dragging is supported).
	The buttons can be clicked, causing them to change to a different image
	which is supposed to look like they are pressed in (I'm not an artist,
	okay).
	Callbacks get called when the buttons are released, but nothing is in
	the callbacks yet.
	The resizing bars can be dragged and the overall window resizes
	correctly, but the contents of the window don't yet reflow to fit the
	new size.
	Clicking on a window brings it to the front.
	Moving a mouse over a window calls a callback which is intended to
	change the look of the window somehow to indicate that it is in focus.
	When a client exits, the parent window and it's children are
	correctly destroyed.
	The mouse pointer changes when over the resize bars to indicate the
	direction in which the window will be resized on dragging it.
