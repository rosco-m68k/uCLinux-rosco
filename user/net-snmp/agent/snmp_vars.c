 *      Each variable name is placed in the variable table, without the
 * terminating substring that determines the instance of the variable.  When
 * a string is found that is lexicographicly preceded by the input string,
 * the function for that entry is called to find the method of access of the
 * instance of the named variable.  If that variable is not found, NULL is
 * returned, and the search through the table continues (it will probably
 * stop at the next entry).  If it is found, the function returns a character
 * pointer and a length or a function pointer.  The former is the address
 * of the operand, the latter is a write routine for the variable.
 *
 * u_char *
 * findVar(name, length, exact, var_len, write_method)
 * oid      *name;          IN/OUT - input name requested, output name found
 * int      length;         IN/OUT - number of sub-ids in the in and out oid's
 * int      exact;          IN - TRUE if an exact match was requested.
 * int      len;            OUT - length of variable or 0 if function returned.
 * int      write_method;   OUT - pointer to function to set variable,
 *                                otherwise 0
 *
 *     The writeVar function is returned to handle row addition or complex
 * writes that require boundary checking or executing an action.
 * This routine will be called three times for each varbind in the packet.
 * The first time for each varbind, action is set to RESERVE1.  The type
 * and value should be checked during this pass.  If any other variables
 * in the MIB depend on this variable, this variable will be stored away
 * (but *not* committed!) in a place where it can be found by a call to
 * writeVar for a dependent variable, even in the same PDU.  During
 * the second pass, action is set to RESERVE2.  If this variable is dependent
 * on any other variables, it will check them now.  It must check to see
 * if any non-committed values have been stored for variables in the same
 * PDU that it depends on.  Sometimes resources will need to be reserved
 * in the first two passes to guarantee that the operation can proceed
 * during the third pass.  During the third pass, if there were no errors
 * in the first two passes, writeVar is called for every varbind with action
 * set to COMMIT.  It is now that the values should be written.  If there
 * were errors during the first two passes, writeVar is called in the third
 * pass once for each varbind, with the action set to FREE.  An opportunity
 * is thus provided to free those resources reserved in the first two passes.
 * 
 * writeVar(action, var_val, var_val_type, var_val_len, statP, name, name_len)
