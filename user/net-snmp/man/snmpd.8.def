.SH NAME
snmpd - daemon to respond to SNMP request packets.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpd
[OPTIONS] [LISTENING ADDRESSES]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpd
is an SNMP agent which binds to a port and awaits requests from
SNMP management software.  Upon receiving a request, it processes the
request(s), collects the requested information and/or performs the
requested operation(s) and returns the information to the sender.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -a
Log the source addresses of incoming requests.
.TP
.B -A
Append to the log file rather than truncating it.
.TP
.B "-c" \fIFILE
Read 
.I FILE
as a configuration file.
.TP
.B -C
Do not read any configuration files except the one optionally specified by the 
.B -c 
option.
.TP
.B -d
Dump (in hexadecimal) the sent and received SNMP packets.
.TP
.B -D\fI[TOKEN[,...]]
Turn on debugging output for the given
.IR "TOKEN" "(s)."
Without any tokens specified, it defaults to printing all the tokens
(which is equivalent to the keyword "ALL").
You might want to try
.IR ALL
for extremely verbose output.  Note: You can not put a space between
the -D flag and the listed TOKENs.
.TP
.B -f
Do not fork() from the calling shell.
.TP
.B -g \fIGID
Change to the numerical group ID
.I GID
after opening listening sockets.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Display a brief usage message and then exit.
.TP
.B -H
Display a list of configuration file directives understood by the
agent and then exit.
.TP
.B -I \fI[-]INITLIST
This option specifies which modules you do (or do not) want to be
initialized when the agent starts up.  If the comma-separated
.I INITLIST
is preceded
with a '-', it is the list of modules that you do
.I not
want to be started.  Otherwise,
.I INITLIST
is the list of modules to be started.

To get a list of compiled modules, run the agent with the arguments
.I "-Dmib_init -H"
(assumes you have debugging support compiled in).
.TP
.BR -l "" " " "[\fIFILE" "" "]"
Log all output from the agent (including stdout and stderr) to 
.IR FILE .
If no filename is given, log to a default file set at compile time
(normally /var/log/snmpd.log).
.TP
.B -L
Do not open a log file; print all messages to stderr instead.
.TP
.B -P \fIFILE
Save the process ID of the daemon in
.IR FILE "."
.TP 
.B -q
Print simpler output for easier automated parsing.
.TP
.B -r
Do not require root access to run the daemon.  Specifically, do not exit
if files only accessible to root (such as /dev/kmem etc.) cannot be
opened.
.TP
.B -s
Use syslog for logging.
.TP
.BR -S " d|0-7"
Specifies the syslog facility to use when logging to syslog.  'd' means
.B LOG_DAEMON
and 0 through 7 mean 
.BR LOG_LOCAL0 " through " LOG_LOCAL7 ".  " LOG_DAEMON " is the default."
.TP
.B -u \fIUID
Change to the user ID
.I UID
(which can be given in numerical or textual form) after opening
listening sockets.
.TP
.B -v, --version
Print version information for the agent and then exit.
.TP
.B -V
Symbolically dump SNMP transactions.
.TP
.B -x \fIADDRESS
Listens for AgentX connections on the specified address
rather than the default '/var/agentx/master'.
The address can either be a Unix domain socket path,
or the address of a network interface.  The format is the same as the
format of listening addresses described below.
.TP
.B -X
Run as an AgentX subagent rather than as an SNMP master agent.

.SH LISTENING ADDRESSES
By default,
.B snmpd
listens for incoming SNMP requests only on UDP port 161.  However, it
is possible to modify this behaviour by specifying one or more
listening addresses as arguments to
.BR snmpd .
A listening address takes the form:
.IP
[<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>
.PP
At its simplest, a listening address may consist only of a port
number, in which case
.B snmpd
listens on that UDP port on all IPv4 interfaces.  Otherwise, the
<transport-address> part of the specification is parsed according to
the following table:
.RS 4
.TP 28
.BR "<transport-specifier>"
.BR "<transport-address> format"
.IP "udp" 28
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv4-address[:port]
.IP "tcp" 28
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv4-address[:port]
.IP "unix" 28
pathname
.IP "ipx" 28
[network]:node[/port]
.TP 28 
.IR "" "aal5pvc " or " pvc"
[interface.][VPI.]VCI
.TP 28
.IR "" "udp6 " or " udpv6 " or " udpipv6"
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv6-address[:port]
.TP 28
.IR "" "tcp6 " or " tcpv6 " or " tcpipv6"
hostname[:port]
.I or
IPv6-address[:port]
.RE
.PP
Note that <transport-specifier> strings are case-insensitive so that,
for example, "tcp" and "TCP" are equivalent.  Here are some examples,
along with their interpretation:
.TP 24
.IR "127.0.0.1:161"
listen on UDP port 161, but only on the loopback interface.  This
prevents
.B snmpd
being queried remotely (which is a bit pointless).  The ":161" is
redundant here since that is the default SNMP port in any case.
.TP 24
.IR "TCP:1161"
listen on TCP port 1161 on all IPv4 interfaces.
.TP 24
.IR "ipx:/40000"
listen on IPX port 40000 on all IPX interfaces.
.TP 24
.IR "unix:/tmp/local-agent"
listen on the Unix domain socket 
.IR /tmp/local-agent .
.TP 24
.IR "/tmp/local-agent"
identical to the previous specification, since the Unix domain is the
default transport iff the first character of the <transport-address>
is a '/'.
.TP 24
.IR "PVC:161"
listen on the AAL5 permanent virtual circuit with VPI=0 and VCI=161
(decimal) on the first ATM adapter in the machine.
.TP 24
.IR "udp6:10161"
listen on port 10161 on all IPv6 interfaces.
.PP
Note that not all the transport domains listed above will always be
available; for instance, hosts with no IPv6 support will not be able
to use udp6 transport addresses, and attempts to do so will result in
the error "Error opening specified endpoint".  Likewise, since AAL5
PVC support is only currently available on Linux, it will fail with
the same error on other platforms.

.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.PP
.B snmpd
checks for the existence of and parses the following files:
.TP 6
.B SYSCONFDIR/snmp/snmp.conf
Common configuration for the agent and applications. See
.I snmp.conf(5)
for details.
.TP
.B SYSCONFDIR/snmp/snmpd.conf
.TP
.B SYSCONFDIR/snmp/snmpd.local.conf
Agent-specific configuration.  See
.I snmpd.conf(5)
for details.  These files are optional and may be used to configure
access control, trap generation, subagent protocols and much else
besides.
.IP
In addition to these two configuration files in SYSCONFDIR/snmp, the
agent will read any files with the names
.I snmpd.conf
and
.I snmpd.local.conf
in a colon separated path specified in the
SNMPCONFPATH environment variable.
.TP
.B DATADIR/snmp/mibs/
The agent will also load all files in this directory as MIBs.  It will
not, however, load any file that begins with a '.' or descend into
subdirectories.
