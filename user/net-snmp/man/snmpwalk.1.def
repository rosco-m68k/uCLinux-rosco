.TH SNMPWALK 1 "08 Feb 2002" VVERSIONINFO "Net-SNMP"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
snmpwalk - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GETNEXT requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpwalk
[APPLICATION OPTIONS] [COMMON OPTIONS] [OID]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpwalk
is an SNMP application that uses SNMP GETNEXT requests to query a
network entity for a tree of information.
.PP
An object identifier (OID) may be given on the command line.  This OID
specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be
searched using GETNEXT requests.  All variables in the subtree
below the given OID are queried and their values presented to the user.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables(5) .
.PP
If no OID argument is present,
.B snmpwalk
will search MIB-2.
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
pinpoint why the request was malformed.
.PP
If the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the end of the
MIB, the message "End of MIB" will be displayed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -Cc
Do not check whether the returned OIDs are increasing.  Some agents
(LaserJets are an example) return OIDs out of order, but can
complete the walk anyway.  Other agents return OIDs that are out of
order and can cause
.B snmpwalk
to loop indefinitely.  By default,
.B snmpwalk
tries to detect this behavior and warns you when it hits an agent
acting illegally.  Use
.B -Cc
to turn off this behaviour.
.TP
.B -Ci
Include the given OID in the search range.  Normally
.B snmpwalk
uses GETNEXT requests starting with the OID you specified and returns
all results in the MIB tree after that OID.  Sometimes, you may wish
to include the OID specified on the command line in the printed
results if it is a valid OID in the tree itself.  This option lets you
do this.
.TP
.B -Cp
Upon completion of the walk, print the number of variables found.
.PP
In addition to these options,
.B snmpwalk
takes the common options described in the 
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
.SH EXAMPLE
The command:
.PP
snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 zeus system
.PP
will retrieve all of the variables under system:
.PP
sysDescr.0 = STRING: "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.br
sysObjectID.0 = OID: enterprises.hp.nm.hpsystem.10.1.1
.br
sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (155274552) 17 days, 23:19:05
.br
sysContact.0 = STRING: ""
.br
sysName.0 = STRING: "zeus.net.cmu.edu"
.br
sysLocation.0 = STRING: ""
.br
sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), snmpbulkwalk(1), variables(5).
