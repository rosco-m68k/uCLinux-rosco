.TH SNMPTRAPD 8 "07 Feb 2002" VVERSIONINFO "Net-SNMP"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
snmptrapd - Receive and log SNMP trap messages.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR snmptrapd " [OPTIONS] [LISTENING ADDRESSES]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmptrapd
is an SNMP application that receives and logs SNMP TRAP and INFORM
messages.
.PP
Note: the default is to listen on UDP port 162 on all IPv4 interfaces.
Since 162 is a privileged port,
.B snmptrapd
must be typically be run as root.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -a
Ignore authenticationFailure traps.
.TP
.BI "-c" " FILE"
Read 
.I FILE
as a configuration file.
.TP
.B -C
Do not read any configuration files except the one optionally specified by the 
.B -c 
option.
.TP
.B -d
Dump (in hexadecimal) the sent and received SNMP packets.
.TP
.BI -D " TOKEN[,...]"
Turn on debugging output for the given
.IR "TOKEN" "(s)."
Try
.IR ALL
for extremely verbose output.
.TP
.B -e
Print event numbers (rising/falling alarm etc.).
.TP
.B -f
Do not fork() from the calling shell.
.TP
.BI -F " FORMAT"
When logging to standard output, use the format in the string
.IR FORMAT .
See the section
.B FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS
below for more details.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Display a brief usage message and then exit.
.TP
.B -H
Display a list of configuration file directives understood by the
trap daemon and then exit.
.TP
.BR -l " d|0-7"
Specifies the syslog facility to use when logging to syslog.  'd' means
.B LOG_DAEMON
and 0 through 7 mean 
.BR LOG_LOCAL0 " through " LOG_LOCAL7 ".  " LOG_LOCAL0 " is the default."
.TP
.BR -m " \fIMIBLIST"
Specifies a colon separated list of MIB modules to load for this
application.  This overrides the environment variable MIBS.
.TP
.BR -M " \fIDIRLIST"
Specifies a colon separated list of directories to search for MIBs.
This overrides the environment variable MIBDIRS.
.TP
.BR -n
Do not attempt to translate source addresses of incoming packets into
hostnames.
.TP
.BI -o " FILE"
Log formatted incoming traps to 
.IR FILE .
Upon receipt of a SIGHUP, the daemon will close and re-open
the log file.  This feature is useful when rotating the log file with
other utilities such as logrotate.
.TP
.B -P
Print formatted incoming traps to stderr.
.TP
.B -s
Log formatted incoming traps to syslog.  These syslog messages are
sent with a level of 
.B LOG_WARNING
and facility as determined by the
.BR -l " flag (" LOG_LOCAL0 
by default).  This is the default unless the
.BR -o " or " -P
flag is used.
.TP
.BI -u " FILE"
Save the process ID of the trap daemon in
.IR FILE "."
.TP
.B -v, --version
Print version information for the trap daemon and then exit.
.PP
In addition,
.B snmptrapd
takes the same output formatting 
.BR "" ( -O ) 
options as the other Net-SNMP commands.  See the section
.B OUTPUT OPTIONS
in the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
.SH FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS
.PP
.B snmptrapd
interprets format strings similarly to
.IR printf(3) .
It understands the following formatting sequences:
.RS 4
.TP 4
.B %%
a literal %
.TP
.B %t
decimal number of seconds since the operating system's epoch (as
returned by
.IR time(2) )
.TP
.B %y
current year on the local system
.TP
.B %m
current (numeric) month on the local system
.TP
.B %l
current day of month on the local system
.TP
.B %h
current hour on the local system
.TP
.B %j
current minute on the local system
.TP
.B %k
current second on the local system
.TP
.B %T
the value of the sysUpTime.0 varbind in seconds
.TP
.B %Y
the year field from the sysUpTime.0 varbind
.TP
.B %M
the numeric month field from the sysUpTime.0 varbind
.TP
.B %L
the day of month field from the sysUpTime.0 varbind
.TP
.B %H
the hour field from the sysUpTime.0 varbind
.TP
.B %J
the minute field from the sysUpTime.0 varbind
.TP
.B %K
the seconds field from the sysUpTime.0 varbind
.TP
.B %a
the contents of the agent-addr field of the PDU (v1 TRAPs only)
.TP
.B %A
the hostname corresponding to the contents of the agent-addr field of
the PDU, if available, otherwise the contents of the agent-addr field
of the PDU (v1 TRAPs only).
.TP
.B %b
PDU source address (Note: this is not necessarily an IPv4
address)
.TP
.B %B
PDU source hostname if available, otherwise PDU source address (see
note above) 
.TP
.B %N
enterprise string
.TP
.B %w
trap type (numeric, in decimal)
.TP
.B %W
trap description
.TP
.B %q
trap sub-type (numeric, in decimal)
.TP
.B %P
security information from the PDU (community name for v1/v2c,
user and context for v3)
.TP
.B %v
list of trap's variable-bindings
.RE
.PP
In addition to these values, you may also specify an optional field
width and precision, just as in 
.IR printf(3) ,
and a flag value. The following flags are legal:
.RS 4 
.TP 4
.B -
left justify
.TP
.B 0
use leading zeros
.TP
.B #
use alternate form
.RE
.PP
The "use alternate form" flag changes the behavior of some format
flags. Normally, the fields that display time information base it on
the local timezone, but this flag tells them to use GMT instead.
Also, the variable-binding list is normally a tab-separated list, but
this flag changes it to a comma-separated one. The alternate form for
the uptime is similar to "3 days, 0:14:34.65"
.SS Examples:
.PP
To get a message like "14:03 TRAP3.1 from humpty.ucd.edu" you 
could use something like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
snmptrapd -P -F "%02.2h:%02.2j TRAP%w.%q from %A\en"
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you want the same thing but in GMT rather than local time, use
.PP
.RS
.nf
snmptrapd -P -F "%#02.2h:%#02.2j TRAP%w.%q from %A\en"
.fi
.RE
.SH LISTENING ADDRESSES
By default,
.B snmptrapd
listens for incoming SNMP TRAP and INFORM packets on UDP port 162 on
all IPv4 interfaces.  However, it is possible to modify this behaviour
by specifying one or more listening addresses as arguments to
.BR snmptrapd .
See the
.I snmpd(8)
manual page for more information about the format of listening
addresses.
.SH NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB SUPPORT
As of net-snmp 5.0, the snmptrapd application supports the
NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB.  It does this by opening an AgentX subagent
connection to the master snmpd agent and registering the notification
log tables.  As long as the snmpd application is started first, it
will attach itself to it and thus you should be able to view the last
recorded notifications via the nlmLogTable and nlmLogVariableTable.
See the snmptrapd.conf file and the "dontRetainLogs" token for turning
off this support.  See the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB for more details about
the MIB itself.
.SH EXTENSIBILITY AND CONFIGURATION
See the
.I snmptrapd.conf(5)
manual page.
