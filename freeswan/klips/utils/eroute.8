.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Eroute
manages the IPSEC extended routing tables,
which control what (if any) processing is applied
to non-encrypted packets arriving for IPSEC processing and forwarding.
The form with no additional arguments lists the contents of
/proc/net/ipsec_eroute.
The
.B \-\-add
form adds a table entry, the
.B \-\-replace
form replaces a table entry, while the
.B \-\-del
form deletes one.  The
.B \-\-clear
form deletes the entire table.
.PP
A table entry consists of:
.IP + 3
source and destination addresses,
with masks,
for selection of packets
.IP +
Security Association IDentifier, comprised of:
.IP + 6
protocol
(\fIproto\fR), indicating (together with the
effective destination and the security parameters index)
which Security Association should be used to process the packet
.IP +
address family
(\fIaf\fR),
.IP +
Security Parameters Index
(\fIspi\fR), indicating (together with the
effective destination and protocol)
which Security Association should be used to process the packet
(must be larger than or equal to 0x100)
.IP +
effective destination
(\fIedst\fR),
where the packet should be forwarded after processing
(normally the other security gateway)
.IP + 3
OR
.IP + 6
SAID
(\fIsaid\fR), indicating 
which Security Association should be used to process the packet
.PP
Addresses are written as IPv4 dotted quads or IPv6 coloned hex,
protocol is one of "ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun" and SPIs are
prefixed hexadecimal numbers where '.' represents IPv4 and ':'
stands for IPv6.
.PP
SAIDs are written as "protoafSPI@address".  There are also 5
"magic" SAIDs which have special meaning:
.IP + 3
.B %drop
means that matches are to be dropped
.IP +
.B %reject
means that matches are to be dropped and an ICMP returned, if
possible to inform
.IP +
.B %trap
means that matches are to trigger an ACQUIRE message to the Key
Management daemon(s) and a hold eroute will be put in place to
prevent subsequent packets also triggering ACQUIRE messages.
.IP +
.B %hold
means that matches are to stored until the eroute is replaced or
until that eroute gets reaped
.IP +
.B %pass
means that matches are to allowed to pass without IPSEC processing
.PP
The format of /proc/net/ipsec_eroute is listed in ipsec_eroute(5).
