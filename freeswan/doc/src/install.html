<h1><a name="install">Installing FreeS/WAN from source</a></h1>

<h2><a name="who.install">Not everyone needs to install from source</a></h2>

<p>Some Linux distributions, <a href="intro.html#distwith">listed in the
introduction</a>, ship with FreeS/WAN included. If you are using one of them,
you need not perform a FreeS/WAN installation. That should all be done for
you already. All you have to do is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>include FreeS/WAN in your installation choices, or add it to your
    configuration later</li>
  <li>if you install kernel source, be sure to use a version which includes
    the FreeS/WAN patches. This should be available from your CDs or from the
    web site for your distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>For other distributions, you may be able to find pre-packaged RPMs and use
the <a href="quickstart.html">simple installation</a> we describe in our
quicksatrt document.</p>

<p>If either of those methods works for you, we recommend you use it. Once
that is done, continue at <a href="quickstart.html#enable">enabling
FreeS/WAN</a> in our quickstart document.</p>

<h2>Some people do need to install from source</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, due to <a href="politics.html#exlaw">export laws</a>
restricting distribution of strong cryptography, not all distributions
include FreeS/WAN. Moreover, the standard kernel does not include the kernel
parts of FreeS/WAN.</p>

<p>Also, if you need to add patches to the FreeS/WAN code (see <a
href="web.html#patch">this list</a>), you need to do that and then install
FreeS/WAN from the patched source.</p>

<p>Many people will need to install FreeS/WAN from source, including patching
and rebuilding their kernel.</p>

<p>Information on <a href="#not-install">re-installing or un-installing</a>
is provided near the end of this document.</p>

<h2><a name="before">Before starting the install</a></h2>

<p>Configure, compile, install, and test a Linux kernel, without
FreeS/WAN.</p>

<p>If you have not done this before, you will need to read the <a
href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HowTo</a>.
You might also look at this <a
href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/print/0,23102,2433297,00.html">magazine
article</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="choosek">Choosing a kernel</a></h3>

<p>The general rule is choose a current release of a production kernel -- the
latest 2.2 or 2.4.</p>

<p>For specific information on which kernels a FreeS/WAN release supports,
see the <a href="../README">README</a> file in that release.</p>

<h4><a name="2.2">2.2.x for many users</a></h4>

<p>Many users can continue to run kernels from the 2.2 series of Linux
production <a href="glossary.html#kernel">kernels</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend using the latest release in that series. At time of writing
(Feb 2002), that is 2.2.20.</p>

<p>If you need to use an older 2.2.x kernel for some reason, be warned that
recent versions of FreeS/WAN will not compile out-of-the-box on a kernel
earlier than 2.2.19. A workaround is described in the FreeS/WAN 1.91 section
of our <a href="../CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file. See the <a
href="mail.html">mailing list archives</a>, around June 2001, for more
details if needed.</p>

<h4><a name="2.4">2.4.x is possible</a></h4>
The 2.4 series of kernels are currently (Feb 2002) at 2.4.18.

<p>2.4 has new firewalling code called <a
href="http://www.netfilter.org">nefilter</a>. This may provide good reasons
to move to 2.4, especially on for gateway machines.</p>

<p><strong>Do not use 2.4.15</strong>; it has a bug that causes file system
corruption.</p>

<h4><a name="2.0">2.0.x may still work</a></h4>

<p>If you must use the older 2.0.x kernel series -- for example because you
need some driver that has not been ported to later kernels -- you may be in
luck. When last tested, FreeS/WAN worked fine on 2.0.39.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you may have problems in the future. Recent versions of
FreeS/WAN are not heavily tested on 2.0 kernels -- most of both the
development team and the user community are on 2.2, or even 2.4, by now --
and <strong>we are almost certain to drop 2.0 support</strong> whenever some
problem crops up that would mean retaining it required significant work from
our team.</p>

<h4><a name="devkernel">Development kernels</a></h4>
Development kernels are a separate series, work-in-progress versions for use
by kernel developers. By convention, production kernels have an even second
digit in the version number (2.0, 2.2, 2.4) and development kernels have an
odd digit there (2.1, 2.3, 2.5).

<p><strong>Development kernels are not intended for production use</strong>.
They change often and include new code which has not yet been thoroughly
tested. <strong>These changes often break things, including
FreeS/WAN</strong>. The FreeS/WAN team does not have the resources to chase
the moving target; our priority is developing FreeS/WAN on stable kernels. If
you encounter a problem on a development kernel, please solve it (you are a
developer, aren't you?) and send us a patch. Of course, we will happily
discuss problems and solutions on the <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>,
but we are unlikely to do much work on actually implementing a solution.</p>

<p>Fortunately we have a user who regularly fixes problems with FreeS/WAN on
development kernels (merci, Marc), and we do fix some ourselves. FreeS/WAN
often works just fine on a development kernel; it's just that there's no
guarantee.</p>

<p>If you are going to test FreeS/WAN with a development kernel, we recommend
you <strong>use our latest snapshot</strong>. This is the FreeS/WAN version
most likely to have the patches required to work on a recent development
kernel. The released version of FreeS/WAN is likely to be out of date for
your purposes.</p>

<h3><a name="getkernel">Things you must have installed</a></h3>

<p>If you have a CD distribution of Linux, it should include everything you
need.</p>

<h4><a name="tool.lib" ">Tools and libraries</a></h4>
<p>
Use your distribution's tools to load:
<ul>
  <li>tools
    <ul>
      <li>a GNU C compiler (gcc or egcs)</li>
      <li>assembler and linker for your architecture (the bin86 package on
        PCs)</li>
      <li>miscellaneous development tools such as make(1) and patch(1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>libraries, both headers and object modules
    <ul>
      <li>standard compiler libraries such as glibc</li>
      <li>the GMP (<strong>G</strong>NU
        <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>P</strong>recision) library, required
        for Pluto's public key calculations.</li>
      <li>ncurses library if you want to use menuconfig (recommended)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are some <strong>common slips</strong> worth avoiding here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not installing the GMP library. Pluto will not compile without it. See
    the FreeS/WAN FAQ for <a href="faq.html#gmp.h_missing">more detail</a> if
    required.</li>
  <li>not installing patch(1). Our scripts need it to apply our patches to
    the kernel.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="kernel.">Kernel source code</a></h4>
<p>
You need the source code for the kernel because you must patch and re-compile
it to install FreeS/WAN. There are several places you can get this:
<ul>
  <li>off your distribution CDs</li>
  <li>from your ditribution vendor's website</li>
  <li>from kernel.org</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="kernel.cd">Kernel from CD</a></h5>
You can install the kernel from your distribution CD. It may be in two
packages.
<ul>
  <li>kernel source</li>
  <li>kernel headers</li>
</ul>
However, if your CD is not recent, it may have an older kernel, in which case
we suggest getting more recent kernel source from the net.

<h5>Vendor kernels</h5>

<p>All the major distribution vendors provide kernel source. See for
example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Red Hat's list of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors.html">mirror
    sites</a></li>
  <li>SuSE's <a
    href="http://www.suse.com/us/support/download/index.html">download
    page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Using a kernel from your distribution vendor may save you some annoyance
later.</p>

<p>Different distributions put the kernel in different places (/vmlinuz,
/boot/vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.15 ...) and set lilo (the
<strong>Li</strong>nux <strong>lo</strong>ader) up differently. With a kernel
from your distribution vendor, everything should work right. With other
combinations, a newly compiled kernel may be installed in one place while
lilo is looking in another. You can of course adjust the kernel Makefile
and/or /etc/lilo.conf to solve this problem, but we suggest just avoiding
it.</p>

<p>Also, distributions vendors may include patches or drivers which are not
part of the standard kernel. If you install a standard kernel, you must
either do without those features or download those patches and add them
yourself.</p>

<h5>Kernels from kernel.org</h5>
For kernels direct from Linus, without any distribution vendor's
modifications, see the <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org</a> mirror list, or go
directly to <nobr><var>ftp.&lt;country&gt;.kernel.org</var>,</nobr>with the
appropriate two-letter country code inserted.

<h4>Once you've found a kernel</h4>

<p>Once you have found suitable kernel source, choose a mirror that is close
to you and bookmark it.</p>

<p>Kernel source normally resides in <var>/usr/src/linux</var>, whether you
load it from a distribution CD or download a tar file into
<var>/usr/src</var> and untar it there. Unless you both have unusual
requirements and know exactly what you're doing, we recommend you put it
there.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some recent distributions (certainly Redhat 7.2 and
Mandrake 8.1, perhaps others) put kernel source code in a directory named
<var>linux-2.4</var> while FreeS/WAN expects to find it in <var>linux</var>,
which is where all distributions used to put it and the kernel.org kernels
still do. If your distribution uses <var>linux-2.4</var>, then <strong>you
must create a symbolic link to <var>linux</var></strong> before proceeding
with your FreeS/WAN install. See the man page for ln(1) for details of how to
do this if required.</p>

<h3>Getting FreeS/WAN</h3>

<p>You can download FreeS/WAN from our <a
href="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/">primary site</a> or one of
our <a href="intro.html#sites">mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>Put the tarfile under <var>/usr/src</var> and untar it there. The command
to use is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tar -xzf freeswan*.gz</li>
</ul>

<p>This will give you a directory
<var>/usr/src/freeswan&lt;version&gt;</var>.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>these methods don't work:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>putting freeswan under <var>/usr/src/linux</var>. The links become
    confused.</li>
  <li>untarring in one place, then using <var>cp -R</var> to move it where
    you want it. Some necessary symbolic links are not copied.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="kconfig">Kernel configuration</a></h3>

<p>The gateway kernel must be configured before FreeS/WAN is added because
some of our utilities rely on the results of configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Note for Redhat 7.1 users</strong>: If you are using the
Redhat-supplied kernel, then you <strong>must do a <nobr><var>make
mrproper</var></nobr></strong> command before starting the kernel
configuration. This prevents some unpleasant interactions between Redhat's
config and our patches.</p>

<p>On some distributions, you can get the configuration files for the
vendor's standard kernel(s) off the CD, and use that. This allows you to skip
this step; you need not configure the kernel if the vendor has <em>and you
have the vendor's config file installed</em>. Here is a mailing list message
describing the procedure for Redhat:</p>
<pre>Subject: Re: [Users] Do I need to recompile kernel 2.2.17-14?
   Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 08:38:38 -0500
   From: "Corey J. Steele" &lt;csteele@mtron.com&gt;

if you install the corresponding kernel-source-*.rpm, you can actually find
the config file used to build that kernel in /usr/src/linux/Configs, just
copy the one you want to use (based solely on architecture) to
/usr/src/linux/.config, and proceed!  It should work.</pre>
If you have ever configured the kernel yourself on this machine, you can also
skip this step.

<p>If the kernel has not been configured, do that now. This is done by giving
one of the following commands in <var>/usr/src/linux</var>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make config</dt>
    <dd>command-line interface</dd>
  <dt>make menuconfig</dt>
    <dd>text menus (requires curses(3) libraries)</dd>
  <dt>make xconfig</dt>
    <dd>using the X window system (requires X, not recommended for
    gateways)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Any of these wiil do the job. If you have no established preference, we
suggest trying <var>menuconfig</var>.</p>

<p>For more information on configuring your kernel, see our <a
href="kernel.html">section</a> on that topic.</p>

<h3><a name="inst-test">Install and test a kernel before adding
FreeS/WAN</a></h3>

<p>You should compile, install and test the kernels as you have configured
them, so that you have a known stable starting point. The series of commands
involved is usually something like:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make menuconfig</dt>
    <dd>choose kernel options, set up a kernel for your machine</dd>
  <dt>make dep</dt>
    <dd>find <strong>dep</strong>endencies between files</dd>
  <dt>make bzImage</dt>
    <dd>build a loadable kernel image, compressed with bzip(1)</dd>
  <dt>make install</dt>
    <dd>install it</dd>
  <dt>make modules</dt>
    <dd>build modules which can be added to a running kernel</dd>
  <dt>make modules_install</dt>
    <dd>install them</dd>
  <dt>lilo</dt>
    <dd>ensure that the boot loader sees your changes</dd>
</dl>

<p>Doing this first means that if there is a problem after you add FreeS/WAN,
tracking it down is <em>much</em> simpler.</p>

<p>If you need advice on this process, or general Linux background
information, try our <a href="web.html#linux.link">Linux web references</a>.
The most directly relevant document is the <a
href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel
HowTo</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="building">Building and installing the software</a></h2>

<p>There are several ways to build and install the software. All require that
you have kernel source, correctly configured for your machine, as a starting
point. If you don't have that yet, see the <a href="#before">previous
section</a></p>

<p>Whatever method you choose, it will do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add FreeS/WAN code to the kernel
    <ul>
      <li>insert patches into standard kernel code to provide an
      interface</li>
      <li>add additional files which use that interface</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>re-configure and re-compile the kernel to activate that code</li>
  <li>install the new kernel</li>
  <li>build the non-kernel FreeS/WAN programs and install them
    <ul>
      <li><a href="manpage.d/ipsec.8.html">ipsec(8)</a> in
        <var>/usr/local/sbin</var></li>
      <li>others in <var>/usr/local/lib/ipsec</var></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>install FreeS/WAN <a href="manpages.html">man pages</a> under
    <var>/usr/local/man</var></li>
  <li>create the configuration file <a
    href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a>. Editing this file
    to configure your IPsec gateway is described in the <a
    href="config.html">next section</a>.</li>
  <li>create an RSA public/private key pair for your system and place it in
    <a href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">ipsec.secrets(5)</a></li>
  <li>install the initialisation script <var>/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipsec</var></li>
  <li>create links to that script from the <var>/etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d</var>
    directories so that each run level starts or stops IPsec. (If the
    previous sentence makes no sense to you, try the <a
    href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html">From
    Power-up to Bash Prompt HowTo</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do the whole install with two commands (recommended in most cases)
or get into as much of the detail as you like.</p>

<h3><a name="build.rpm">Building RPMs</a></h3>
As of version 1.93, we provide a facilty to build FreeS/WAN RPMs.

<p>Go to the FreeS/WAN directory and do whichever of the following commands
you prefer:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make orpm</dt>
    <dd>uses command-line kernel configuration</dd>
  <dt>make menurpm</dt>
    <dd>uses menu kernel configuration (requires ncurses library)</dd>
  <dt>make xrpm</dt>
    <dd>use X Window kernel configuration (requires X)</dd>
</dl>

<p>After the Makefile does the software and kernel build, it will make some
RPMs and leave them in the <var>rpms</var> directory. The RPMs are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>freeswan</dt>
    <dd>the userland utilities</dd>
  <dt>freeswan-module</dt>
    <dd>the ipsec.o kernel module, built only if your kernel configuration
      sets klips as a module</dd>
  <dt>freeswan-kernel</dt>
    <dd>the Linux kernel and its modules</dd>
  <dt>freeswan-userkernel</dt>
    <dd>all of the above</dd>
</dl>

<p>Once you have the RPMs, you can install FreeS/WAN from them with <var>rpm
-i</var> commands. For a more detailed procedure, go to our <a
href="quickstart.html">quickstart document</a>.</p>

<p>This makes it much easier to build FreeS/WAN on one system for
installation on another.</p>

<p>This facility is based on work by Paul Lahaie at <a
href="http://www.steamballoon.com">Steamballoon</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="build.module">Building IPsec as a module</a></h3>

<p>With the full procedure described in the <a href="#non-rpm">next
section</a>, you can either build the kernel parts of FreeS/WAN into your
kernel or build them as a kernel module, depending on how you set the kernel
configuration options.</p>

<p>Since 1.91, we also provide an option to build only the FreeS/WAN module,
without re-compiling the rest of your kernel.</p>

<p>Note, however, that this requires:</p>
<ul>
  <li>kernel source in <var>/usr/src/linux</var></li>
  <li>kernel has been configured</li>
  <li>source matches the kernel you are actually running</li>
</ul>

<p>To do the module install, give two commands in the FreeS/WAN directory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one of <var>make omod</var>, <var>make menumod</var> or <var>make
    xmod</var></li>
  <li><var>make minstall</var></li>
</ul>

<p>This is relatively new code and not yet tested on a wide range of systems.
If it does not work for you, please report the problem. In the meanwhile,
fall back to the older procedure described next..</p>

<h3><a name="non-rpm">Installing directly from source</a></h3>
You can also install FreeS/WAN directly from the source, without building
RPMs as an intermediate step.

<p>There are two steps here. First you do everything else, then you install
the new FreeS/WAN-enabled kernel.</p>

<h4><a name="allbut">Everything but kernel installation</a></h4>

<p>To do everything except install the new kernel, <var>cd</var> into the
freeswan directory and become root. Give <strong>any one</strong> of the
following commands:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make oldgo</dt>
    <dd>Uses FreeS/WAN's default settings for some kernel configuration
      options. Leaves all other options unchanged from your last kernel
      configuration.</dd>
  <dt>make ogo</dt>
    <dd>Invokes <var>config</var> so you can configure the kernel from the
      command line.</dd>
  <dt>make menugo</dt>
    <dd>Invokes <var>menuconfig</var> so you can configure the kernel with
      text-mode menus.</dd>
  <dt>make xgo</dt>
    <dd>Invokes <var>xconfig</var> so you can configure the kernel in an X
      window.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You must <strong>save the new configuration even if you make no
changes</strong>. This ensures that the FreeS/WAN changes are actually seen
by the system.</p>

<p>There are few options in the FreeS/WAN part of kernel configuration. For
most of them, we recommend that you make no changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In particular, <strong>please do not disable FreeS/WAN debugging during
    kernel configuration</strong>. This code has no effect unless you turn it
    on with <var>klipsdebug</var> in your <a
    href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a> file, and therefore
    no cost other than a modest increase in kernel size. However, if you
    disable it and then run into problems, we may not be able to help
  you.</li>
  <li>One thing you can change is whether KLIPS is compiled into the kernel
    or as a module. The FreeS/WAN intialisation scripts work with either
    configuration, automatically loading the module if required, so it is
    your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our scripts save the output of <var>make</var> commands they call in files
with names like <var>out.kbuild</var> or <var>out.kinstall</var>. The last
command of each script checks the appropriate <var>out.*</var> file for error
messages.
<ul>
  <li>If the last output you see is <var>make</var> saying it is calling our
    <var>errcheck</var> script, then all is well. There were no errors.</li>
  <li>If not, an error has occurred. Check the appropriate <var>out.*</var>
    file for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the above commands, the error files are <var>out.kpatch</var> and
<var>out.kbuild</var>.</p>

<p>These scripts automatically build an <a href="glossary.html#RSA">RSA</a>
authentication key pair (a public key and the matching private key) for you,
and put the result in <var>/etc/ipsec.secrets</var>. For information on using
RSA authentication, see our <a href="config.html">configuration section</a>.
Here, we need only note that generating the key uses random(4) quite heavily
and if random(4) runs out of randomness, <strong>it will block until it has
enough input</strong>. You may need to provide input by moving the mouse
around a lot, or going to another window and typing random characters, or
using some command such as <var>du -s /usr</var> to generate disk
activity.</p>

<h4><a name="newk">Installing the new kernel</a></h4>

<p>To install the kernel the easy way, just give this command in the
FreeS/WAN directory:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make kinstall</dt>
    <dd>Installs the new kernel and, if required, the modules to go with it.
      Errors, if any, are reported in <var>out.kinstall</var></dd>
</dl>

<p>Using <var>make kinstall</var> from the FreeS/WAN directory is equivalent
to giving the following sequence of commands in <var>/usr/src/linux</var>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make</li>
  <li>make install</li>
  <li>make modules</li>
  <li>make modules_install</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer that sequence, use it instead.</p>

<p>If you have some unusual setup such that the above sequence of commands
won't work on your system, then our <var>make kinstall</var> will not work
either. Use whatever method does work on your system. See our <a
href="impl.notes">implementation notes</a> file for additional information
that may help in such situations.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

<p>At this point, you are finished the install. Go to the quickstart document
section on <a href="quickstart.html#enable">enabling FreeS/WAN</a> and
continue from there.</p>

<p>Alternately, you might want to look at background material on the <a
href="ipsec.html">protocols used</a> before trying configuration.</p>

<h2><a name="not-install">Re-install or un-install</a></h2>
<p>
If you have FreeS/WAN installed from source on this machine, and need to
install a newer version or un-install FreeS/WAN, this section is for you.

<p>If you have FreeS/WAN installed from RPMs, use <var>rpm -e</var> or
<var>rpm -u</var> to uninstall or upgrade.</p>

<h3><a name="re-install">Re-install</a></h3>

<p>The scripts are designed so that a re-install -- to upgrade to a later
FreeS/WAN version or to a later kernel version -- can be done in exactly the
same way as an original install.</p>

<p>The scripts know enough, for example, not to apply the same kernel patch
twice and not to overwrite your <var>ipsec.conf</var> or
<var>ipsec.secrets</var> files. However, they will overwrite the _updown
script. If you have modified that, save your version under another name
before doing the install.</p>

<p>Also, they may not always work exactly as designed. Check the <a
href="../BUGS">BUGS</a> file for any caveats in the current version.</p>

<h4><a name="disable">Disabling FreeS/WAN</a></h4>

<p>In many Linux distributions, you can easily disable FreeS/WAN with the
command:</p>
<pre>    chkconfig --del ipsec</pre>

<p>This removes the symlinks in <var>/etc/rc.d/rc?.d</var> which cause
<var>ipsec(8)</var> to be called at boot time or when switching run levels.
If the kernel part of IPsec, <a href="glossary.html#KLIPS">KLIPS</a>, has
been compiled as a module, then this also prevents loading that module, so
IPsec is completely disabled.</p>

<p>Other distributions may use another version of <var>init(8)</var>, or may
not provide the <var>chkconfig(8)</var> command. For these, you will have to
use other tools, or manually edit the init scripts, to achieve the same
effect.</p>

<h4><a name="remove.files">Removing FreeS/WAN files</a></h4>

<p>If you installed FreeS/WAN from RPMs, then just use<var> rpm -e</var> to
uninstall it. This section is for those who have installed from source.</p>

<p>To entirely remove the user-level FreeS/WAN components from your system,
go to the FreeS/WAN install directory and give the command:</p>
<pre>     make uninstall_freeswan</pre>

<p>If that doesn't work for you -- for example, if FreeS/WAN was built on
another system and copied here -- then you can do it manually. First disable
FreeS/WAN as described above (to avoid problems with symlinks pointing to
things you are about to remove), and then use these commands:</p>
<pre>        rm -f /etc/ipsec.* /usr/local/sbin/ipsec /etc/rc.d/init.d/ipsec
        rm -rf /usr/local/lib/ipsec
        rm -f /usr/local/man/man?/ipsec[._]*</pre>
<p>
You may need to vary the commands slightly if you, or whoever packaged your
distribution, changed the install directories when building FreeS/WAN.

<h4><a name="remove.kernel">Removing FreeS/WAN from the kernel</a></h4>

<p>If you compiled <a href="glossary.html#KLIPS">KLIPS</a> as a module, then
just disabling FreeS/WAN as described <a href="#disable">above</a> prevents
loading the module.</p>

<p>If <a href="glossary.html#KLIPS">KLIPS</a> is compiled into your kernel,
then you can disable it by turning off IPsec in your kernel configuration (or
by making it a module) and recompiling.</p>

<p>You can remove the FreeS/WAN patches from your kernel source by going to
the FreeS/WAN install directory and giving the command:</p>
<pre>     make unpatch</pre>

<p>This does not remove all FreeS/WAN changes; some are not done with
patch(1) and cannot be reversed in this way.</p>

<p>To remove all trace of IPsec in your kernel, you should revert to an
unpatched version, or download fresh kernel source.</p>
