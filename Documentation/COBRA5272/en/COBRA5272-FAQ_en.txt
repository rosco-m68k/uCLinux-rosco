GENERAL

Q: What does "COBRA5272" mean?
A: COBRA stands for "COldfire Board for Rapid Applications". The 5272
   shows that the board is based on Motorola's ColdFire 5272.

Q: Where can I order the board? Is the a web site?
A: You can order the board via the German distributor ELEKTRONIKLADEN.
   Their web site for the board (currently only in German language!) is 
   http://www.elektronikladen.de/cobra5272.html.
   The home page of the board is http://www.sentec-elektronik.de/cobra/.

Q: Ok, now I have the board. What are the first steps I should do
   to get a running image?
A: Now that you have downloaded the uClinux-dist sources please read 
   ./Documentation/COBRA5272/en/COBRA5272-Getting-started_en.txt
   to get started. If you obtained the COBRA5272-CD, you will find 
   all related pdf files in /documentation/board/en.
   
COMMUNICATION

Q: What cable have I to use for communicating via the serial port?
A: You can use a "normal" serial cable, not a so called "null modem
   cable".

Q: What are the standard values for the communication parameters?
A: Serial Port: 19200 Baud, 8n1
   Server IP:   192.168.100.1
   Client IP:   192.168.100.2
   Netmask:     255.255.255.0
   Gateway IP:  0.0.0.0
   Ethernet:    00:00:00:00:00:01 

Q: How can I configure the parameters for the commands that are
   executed on kernel start up?
A: At start-up of the uClinux kernel the commands of the file
   uClinux-dist/vendors/senTec/romfs/etc/rc get executed.
   Here you can configure for instance the IP address, the netmask,
   if, and if so, which directory gets mounted and so on.
   (HINT: To get a detailed description you should look into the
   manual pages of the commands, eg. "man ifconfig").

ERRORS/PROBLEMS

Q: The board allways does a reset. What can I do?
A: Here are some things to check:
   a) Increase the value of the current clamp:
   The power supply should give around 500mA at 6V (if you have a
   (starter kit with a linear voltage regulator you can try to
   increase the voltage to around 7.5V).

   b) Measure the voltage:
   On the starterkit board you find opposite to the bdm connector
   a row of LED's (D3..D10). On the left site of it there is a
   edge connector. There you have plus on the one site, and ground
   on the other. The voltage there should be >3.15V.

Q: "make" gives an error about a missing reference to
   "del_mtd_partitions"?
A: You must set CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONS in the kernel config!

Q: After "make dep" or "make" there are many messages scrolling out
   of the terminal window. How is it possible to read them?
A: You can for instance "pipe" them into the program "tee" that
   writes them into a file, eg. "errs". To do that, just type:
   "make 2>&1 | tee errs".

Q: I want to use the external bus for my own periphals. With the
   oscilloscope I can see, that the external chipselects are
   "floating", and so my periphals cannot work. What can I do?
A: The buffers IC 0201 - IC 0209 (see Schematic p. 3) are selected
   with the same chipselects. When the buffers are disabled, the 
   level of all external signal (includig the chipselects) are
   falling to Ground. To avoid this, the used chipselects can
   be pulled up (eg. with 4,7k) to 3,3V.

Q: I don't have a BDM-Adaptper. Where can I get one?
A: You can look for it for instance at http://www.pemicro.com or
   http://www.cybertec.com.au. Make sure to use a
   "Shielded ColdFire BDM Adapter, 3.3V".
