config SH_DMA
	bool "DMA controller (DMAC) support"
	help
	  Selecting this option will provide same API as PC's Direct Memory
	  Access Controller(8237A) for SuperH DMAC.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NR_DMA_CHANNELS
	int "Maximum number of DMA channels"
	depends on SH_DMA
	default "4"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of DMA channels to
	  support. This will be 4 for SH7750/SH7751 and 8 for SH7750R/SH7751R
	  if only supporting the on-chip DMAC. Setting this to a higher value
	  allows for cascading DMACs with additional channels.

config DMA_PAGE_OPS
	bool "Use DMAC for page copy/clear"
	depends on SH_DMA
	help
	  Selecting this option will use a dual-address mode configured channel
	  in the SH DMAC for copy_page()/clear_page(). Primarily a performance
	  hack.
